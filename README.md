This printf project is designed to mimic the actual printf function in C
The printf remake prints characters and checks for specifiers %, then checks if its in an array [s, c, d and i]
If the character after the % matches any of the elements of that array, it'll channel it to any of the associated functions.
Edge cases were also addressed ()
